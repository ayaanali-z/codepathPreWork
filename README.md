PreWork for 2023 iOS Development Course on CodePath

Some ideas to improve the App are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

# App Brainstorming 

Letterboxd: 
- A mix between Twitter and iMDB 
- Review functionality: Letterboxed allows users to make lists of their favorite films and show it off on their profiles as well as rating and reviewing individual films on a 5-star scale. 
- Commenting: Letterboxd users can comment on any review written for a film, allowing for immediate discourse. 

StockX: 
- A reselling app for sneakers, clothing, and collectibles
- Release Calendar: StockX pulls data from news outlets, product websites, and manufacturers to compile a calendar of upcoming clothing, sneakers, and collectibles that are predicted to be in high demand. This allows users to stay ahead of release timelines and increase their chances of getting rare items which they can then resell on StockX. The app essentially regulates a fully-functioning economy. 
- Portfolio Management: StockX allows users to trace the value of items they bought on StockX and notifies them if an item is below retail price or increasing in value. 

Apple News+: 
- A news aggregator native to Apple's built in suite of apps. 
- News compilation: Apple News+ is a one shot subscription service to several major news outlets including the Wall Street Journal, LA Times, and magazines such as the New Yorker and Vogue. There's also the possibility of onboarding thrid-party subscriptions to other newspapers. For instance, I have a subscription to the Washington Post and was able to incorporate that into my news compilation. 
- Sports analytics: The app is also a one-stop spot for all sports teams. You have the ability to add specific sports and even specific leagues and teams within those sports. In my case, I added Columbia Athletics, Juventus and Chelsea, the NBA, and UFC to my compilation. 

Spotify: 
- A music-listening app that's both free and subcription based. 
- New music exposure: Spotify's most attractive feature in my opinion is the Daily Mixes and curated playlists it compiles based on your listening history. 
- AI-powered DJ: A newer feature of Spotify is an AI-powered DJ that uses your listening history to generate a radio-like experience. I use this a lot as I have a rapidly evolving music taste and my manually created playlists often run stale after a while. I think this is a really interesting incorporation of AI/ML development into an already well-renowned feature of the app.
