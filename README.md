PreWork for 2023 iOS Development Course on CodePath

Some ideas to improve the App are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

# Additional Improvements: 
- Added different fonts to each label
- Added a randomize text button which randomizes the text colors. 
- Added a randomize font method which assigns the fonts of each label to a random font from an array called fonts.
- Added a reset button that returns all colors and fonts back to the defaults.

# Checklist:

[x] User can run application showing a screen with a button and at least a couple of labels. 
[x] The screen has a background color that can changes when the button is tapped.

# App Brainstorming 

Letterboxd: 
- A mix between Twitter and iMDB 
- Review functionality: Letterboxed allows users to make lists of their favorite films and show it off on their profiles as well as rating and reviewing individual films on a 5-star scale. 
- Commenting: Letterboxd users can comment on any review written for a film, allowing for immediate discourse. 

StockX: 
- A reselling app for sneakers, clothing, and collectibles
- Release Calendar: StockX pulls data from news outlets, product websites, and manufacturers to compile a calendar of upcoming clothing, sneakers, and collectibles that are predicted to be in high demand. This allows users to stay ahead of release timelines and increase their chances of getting rare items which they can then resell on StockX. The app essentially regulates a fully-functioning economy. 
- Portfolio Management: StockX allows users to trace the value of items they bought on StockX and notifies them if an item is below retail price or increasing in value. 

Apple News+: 
- A news aggregator native to Apple's built in suite of apps. 
- News compilation: Apple News+ is a one shot subscription service to several major news outlets including the Wall Street Journal, LA Times, and magazines such as the New Yorker and Vogue. There's also the possibility of onboarding thrid-party subscriptions to other newspapers. For instance, I have a subscription to the Washington Post and was able to incorporate that into my news compilation. 
- Sports analytics: The app is also a one-stop spot for all sports teams. You have the ability to add specific sports and even specific leagues and teams within those sports. In my case, I added Columbia Athletics, Juventus and Chelsea, the NBA, and UFC to my compilation. 

Spotify: 
- A music-listening app that's both free and subcription based. 
- New music exposure: Spotify's most attractive feature in my opinion is the Daily Mixes and curated playlists it compiles based on your listening history. 
- AI-powered DJ: A newer feature of Spotify is an AI-powered DJ that uses your listening history to generate a radio-like experience. I use this a lot as I have a rapidly evolving music taste and my manually created playlists often run stale after a while. I think this is a really interesting incorporation of AI/ML development into an already well-renowned feature of the app.

# App Idea 
- I have an idea for creating an app called Goggleboxd (gogglebox is british slang for a television) similar to Letterboxd that combines entertainment with microblogging. Letterboxd's biggest hinderence is that it does not have any TV show database. TV shows are statistically more popular than movies. In fact, 75% of all [user viewing on Netflix](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-03-13/these-are-netflix-s-most-popular-shows-according-to-netflix) is comprised of TV shows. My idea for an app is a microblogging space where users can rank their favorite TV shows on their profiles, review particular episodes based on a star system, create themed lists of both episodes and shows, discover which streaming platforms a show is available on, and follow and comment on each others profiles and reviews. This app can either serve as an extension of Letterboxd or a sister app in which a user's Letterboxd username and password serve as the basis for their account on Goggleboxd (in a similar fashion to how Meta imported Instagram usernames to their new app Threads).
